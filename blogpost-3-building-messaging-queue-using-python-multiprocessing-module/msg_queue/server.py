        able to get the (proxy) object of this Queue and for them, they can
        pretty much use it like a regular queue (however, internally, BaseManager

        fun, we don't have to worry about locking, shared memory handling etc as 
        BaseManager will handle that, and for us it will be like using Queue between
        threads'''
